Problem Statment (restate explicit reqs /identify implicit reqs)
Write a program that manages robot factory settings.

rules:
Robots off the factory floor have no name
The first booted, a random name is generated, e.g. RX837 or BC811.
Resetting a robot to factory settings means name gets wiped.
i.e it will respond with a new random name.
The names must be random;
Names should not follow a predictable sequence.
Solution should not allow use of same name twice

Examples / Test Case:
requires class Robot
requires Robot instance getter method name
requires Robot instance method reset

Algorithm:
create constructor that generates randomly generated name for a robot
use helper methods to generate 2 uppercase char prefix and 3 digit suffix
keep track of names with class variable referencing an array of taken names
only assign generated name to `name` instance variable if name not already taken
create reset instance method that assigns a new name to same robot
